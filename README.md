# RAG USING MiniLM - AMAZON SHAREOLDER LETTER
"RAG (Retrieve, Attend, Generate)" is a groundbreaking approach to text generation and summarization that revolutionizes natural language processing tasks.
Developed based on the principles of retriever-reader architectures, RAG offers a novel framework for handling large-scale text data efficiently.
The RAG architecture consists of three key components: retriever, reader, and generator.
The retriever module efficiently identifies relevant passages from large text corpora using information retrieval techniques.
These passages are then passed to the reader module, which comprehensively understands and extracts relevant information from the retrieved passages.
Finally, the generator module synthesizes the extracted information to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
One of the significant advantages of RAG is its ability to handle complex natural language understanding and generation tasks, such as question-answering, text summarization, and document retrieval.
By combining the strengths of retriever-based information retrieval with reader-based comprehension and generation capabilities, RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance across various NLP benchmarks.
MiniLM models are compact versions of the traditional large-scale language models like GPT or BERT.
They are designed to be smaller in size while still retaining high performance in natural language processing tasks.
These models achieve their compactness through various techniques such as parameter pruning, quantization, or distillation.
Despite their reduced size, MiniLM models maintain a competitive level of accuracy and efficiency, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices or in scenarios where computational resources are limited.
They are particularly useful for tasks like text classification, language understanding, and text generation, offering a balance between model size and performance.
